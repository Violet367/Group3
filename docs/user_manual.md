## Overview

Study Buddy is an application that will be used to address student’s experience of information overload while studying using multiple apps. This information overload can lead to problems like increased distraction and decreased productivity. Study Buddy will have a timer (ideal for using the pomodoro study method), a todo list, and a notes section all within one
application.

#### 1. Timer <br>
On the top left corner is a timer. This would be ideally used for using the Pomodoro study technique,
but the user may use it in the method that would be ideal for them. The default time has been set to 25 minutes, but the user may adjust that by changing the minutes and seconds fields. Once the time has run out, the timer will ring.
The volume should be on, in order for this feature to alert the user.

#### 2. To Do List <br>
The To Do List can be used to keep track of tasks the user must complete. Once they are completed, the user may cross
them out or delete them.

#### 3. Notepad <br>

The Notepad section can be used to take notes for different subjects. The subjects are separated and labeled in tabs.
In order to create a new subject, simply select the “Add” button and enter the name of the subject. An alert will appear on the bottom left when the user has changed tabs. In order to save the notes, select the "Save Notes" button. An alert, on the bottom left corner, will verify with the user to ensure if the notes have been saved.
