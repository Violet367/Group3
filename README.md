### Project Description:
Study Buddy is a productivity enhancing interface that combines a notepad, to-do list, and Pomodoro timer
all on one page. The purpose of this project is to mitigate the information overload that students face while
studying. Students usually have multiple tabs open at the same time while studying, mostly for online notepads,
to-do lists, and timers. Unfortunately this leads to a higher chance of them becoming distracted as they open new
tabs and potentially decide to surf the web. This is a class project for the course INST377 taught by the iSchool at
the University of Maryland, College Park.
